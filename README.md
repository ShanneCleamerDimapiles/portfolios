About Me
-I’m excited to share a little bit about myself. I’m passionate about drawing and painting, and I also love creating short stories that I can read myself.
I’m a huge fan of K-dramas, C-dramas, and Thai dramas, and of course, I absolutely adore anime.
I’m also a proud BTS fan! I’m always looking for new ways to learn and grow in these areas, whether it’s improving my art skills or discovering new shows to binge.
When I’m not immersed in creativity, you’ll probably find me relaxing with a good drama or anime, or just enjoying the little moments that inspire me. 
I believe in staying curious and embracing new challenges, and I’m always excited to meet people who share similar interests.
